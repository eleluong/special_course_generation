### Overview
- **Topic:** Market Research & Data Analytics  
- **Duration:** 1,440 minutes (24 hours)

  2. Design a survey instrument for a target segment  
  3. Interpret basic market data visualizations using Excel and Tableau  

### Sections

1. **Primary & Secondary Market Research Techniques**  
- **Key Points:**  
  - Distinguish primary vs. secondary data, evaluating validity and reliability.  
  - Apply a critical appraisal framework (scope, sampling, bias, cost) to select the most appropriate method for a given research question.  
- **Explanation:**  
  Primary data is collected directly from respondents (surveys, interviews, focus groups) and offers high relevance but higher cost and time. Secondary data comes from existing sources (industry reports, public datasets) and is inexpensive but may lack specificity. A systematic appraisal—considering scope, sampling, bias, cost, and timeliness—guides the choice of method and ensures that insights are both credible and actionable.  
- **Example/Demo:**  
  *Case Study:* A mid‑size apparel brand wants to assess demand for a new sustainable line. The instructor presents two options: (a) purchase a niche industry report (secondary) and (b) conduct a targeted online survey (primary). Learners evaluate each option using the appraisal framework and decide to run a hybrid approach—start with secondary data to define the market size, then launch a focused survey to validate consumer interest.  
- **Engagement Prompt:**  
  *Activity:* In breakout groups, participants receive a brief research scenario (e.g., launching a new tech gadget) and must list the most suitable primary and secondary methods, justifying each choice in 2‑minute pitches.  
- **Timing:** 720 minutes  

2. **Survey Design & Data Visualization**  
- **Key Points:**  
  - Construct a survey instrument aligned with objectives, using clear question types, logical flow, and pilot testing.  
  - Build and interpret Excel pivot tables and Tableau dashboards to uncover actionable insights.  
- **Explanation:**  
  A well‑designed survey starts with a clear objective, followed by question types (open, closed, Likert, ranking) that directly measure that objective. Logical sequencing, concise wording, and a pilot test reduce bias and improve completion rates. Once data is collected, Excel pivot tables summarize frequencies and cross‑tabulations, while Tableau dashboards provide interactive visualizations (bar charts, heat maps, scatter plots) that reveal patterns and support decision‑making.  
- **Example/Demo:**  
  *Live Demo:* The instructor creates a 10‑question survey in Google Forms (demographics, Likert, multiple choice). After exporting the responses to Excel, a pivot table shows average satisfaction by age group. The instructor then builds a Tableau Public dashboard that visualizes satisfaction trends, segment comparisons, and a heat map of geographic interest. Participants follow along, replicating each step in their own accounts.  
- **Engagement Prompt:**  
  *Interactive Lab:* Each learner receives a peer’s draft survey. They must identify one question that could lead to ambiguous responses and rewrite it for clarity, then share the revised question in the chat.  
- **Timing:** 720 minutes  

### Closing
- **Recap:**  
  - Reviewed how to critically appraise primary and secondary research methods and choose the right approach for a specific question.  
  - Practiced end‑to‑end survey creation, data collection, and visualization in Excel and Tableau.  
- **Transition/Next Steps:**  
  Learners will apply these skills in the summative **Digital Marketing Campaign Plan** project, where they must design a survey, analyze the data, and present actionable insights in a dashboard.  
- **Assessment Prep:**  
  Learners should be ready to:  
  1. Critique a research plan and recommend the optimal primary/secondary mix.  
  2. Design a clear, objective‑aligned survey instrument and pilot it.  
  3. Build a pivot table in Excel and publish a Tableau dashboard that highlights key market insights.

### Questions
1. **Type:** [MCQ]  
   - **Stem:** Which of the following best describes a limitation of secondary data?  
   - **Options:**  
     - [A] It is always up‑to‑date.  
     - [B] It may lack relevance to the specific research question.  
     - [C] It requires primary collection.  
     - [D] It has no cost.  
   - **Answer:** [B]  
   - **Rationale:** Secondary data are collected for purposes other than the current research, so they may be outdated, aggregated, or not specific enough to answer a particular question. Option A is incorrect because secondary data can be old; C is incorrect because secondary data are already collected; D is incorrect because while secondary data are often cheaper, they can still have access or licensing costs.  
   - **Alignment:** O1  

2. **Type:** [Short Answer]  
   - **Prompt:** Design a single Likert‑scale question that measures customer satisfaction with a newly launched product. The question should be unbiased, avoid double‑barreled phrasing, and include a clear 5‑point response scale.  
   - **Expected Key Points:**  
     - Clear, single‑statement wording (e.g., “I am satisfied with the new product’s performance.”)  
     - Avoid leading or loaded language.  
     - Use a 5‑point Likert scale (Strongly Disagree – Strongly Agree).  
     - Provide labeled response options (1–5).  
     - No double‑barreled or ambiguous terms.  
   - **Alignment:** O2  

3. **Type:** [Practical Task]  
   - **Task:** Using the provided “Consumer Purchases” dataset,  
     1. Create an Excel pivot table that summarizes the *average purchase amount* for each *age group* (18‑24, 25‑34, 35‑44, 45‑54, 55+).  
     2. Build a Tableau Public dashboard that visualizes this data with:  
        - A bar chart showing average purchase amount by age group.  
        - A heat map indicating purchase frequency across age groups and product categories.  
   - **Submission:**  
     - Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the pivot table.  
     - Tableau workbook (.twbx) with the dashboard.  
   - **Rubric:**  
     - **Data Accuracy (40 %)** – Correct calculations, no errors in pivot table.  
     - **Visualization Clarity (30 %)** – Readable labels, appropriate chart types, color contrast meets WCAG 2.2.  
     - **Insight Extraction (30 %)** – Clear written commentary (≤ 200 words) explaining key findings and implications for marketing strategy.  
   - **Alignment:** O3
