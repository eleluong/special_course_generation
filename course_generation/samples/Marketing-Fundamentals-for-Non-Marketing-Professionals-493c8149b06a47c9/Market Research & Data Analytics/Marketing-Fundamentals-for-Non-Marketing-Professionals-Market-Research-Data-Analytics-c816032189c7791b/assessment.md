### Questions
1. **Type:** [MCQ]  
   - **Stem:** Which of the following best describes a limitation of secondary data?  
   - **Options:**  
     - [A] It is always up‑to‑date.  
     - [B] It may lack relevance to the specific research question.  
     - [C] It requires primary collection.  
     - [D] It has no cost.  
   - **Answer:** [B]  
   - **Rationale:** Secondary data are collected for purposes other than the current research, so they may be outdated, aggregated, or not specific enough to answer a particular question. Option A is incorrect because secondary data can be old; C is incorrect because secondary data are already collected; D is incorrect because while secondary data are often cheaper, they can still have access or licensing costs.  
   - **Alignment:** O1  

2. **Type:** [Short Answer]  
   - **Prompt:** Design a single Likert‑scale question that measures customer satisfaction with a newly launched product. The question should be unbiased, avoid double‑barreled phrasing, and include a clear 5‑point response scale.  
   - **Expected Key Points:**  
     - Clear, single‑statement wording (e.g., “I am satisfied with the new product’s performance.”)  
     - Avoid leading or loaded language.  
     - Use a 5‑point Likert scale (Strongly Disagree – Strongly Agree).  
     - Provide labeled response options (1–5).  
     - No double‑barreled or ambiguous terms.  
   - **Alignment:** O2  

3. **Type:** [Practical Task]  
   - **Task:** Using the provided “Consumer Purchases” dataset,  
     1. Create an Excel pivot table that summarizes the *average purchase amount* for each *age group* (18‑24, 25‑34, 35‑44, 45‑54, 55+).  
     2. Build a Tableau Public dashboard that visualizes this data with:  
        - A bar chart showing average purchase amount by age group.  
        - A heat map indicating purchase frequency across age groups and product categories.  
   - **Submission:**  
     - Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the pivot table.  
     - Tableau workbook (.twbx) with the dashboard.  
   - **Rubric:**  
     - **Data Accuracy (40 %)** – Correct calculations, no errors in pivot table.  
     - **Visualization Clarity (30 %)** – Readable labels, appropriate chart types, color contrast meets WCAG 2.2.  
     - **Insight Extraction (30 %)** – Clear written commentary (≤ 200 words) explaining key findings and implications for marketing strategy.  
   - **Alignment:** O3
