### Sections

1. What Is Marketing? – Definition, evolution, role in business strategy  
- Key Points:  
  - Marketing is a customer‑centric, value‑creating function that connects products to customers.  
  - Marketing aligns cross‑functional teams to deliver a consistent brand promise.  
- Explanation:  
  Marketing is the discipline that identifies customer needs, designs solutions, and communicates value. Over the past decade, it has evolved from mass advertising to data‑driven, AI‑enabled personalization and hybrid touchpoints that blend online and offline experiences. In a modern organization, marketing works hand‑in‑hand with product, sales, finance, and operations to ensure that every decision supports the customer journey and business goals. All content follows WCAG 2.2 AA standards, with high‑contrast visuals, large fonts, and alt‑text for accessibility.  
- Example/Demo:  
  A short video case study of a mid‑size retailer that used AI‑driven analytics to shift from a product‑centric to a customer‑centric strategy, resulting in a 15 % increase in repeat purchase rate.  
- Engagement Prompt:  
  Quick poll: “What does the word ‘marketing’ bring to mind? Choose one: A) Advertising B) Product development C) Customer experience D) Sales.” (Collect responses and display the most common answer.)  
- Timing: 720 minutes  

2. The 4Ps of Marketing – Product, Price, Place, Promotion  
- Key Points:  
  - Each P is a strategic lever that shapes the customer experience and business performance.  
  - The 4Ps interact to form a cohesive marketing mix that must be aligned with the company’s value proposition and target market.  
- Explanation:  
  The 4Ps framework remains the foundation for planning and evaluating any marketing initiative. Product defines what is offered; Price determines the perceived value and revenue; Place ensures the product is accessible; Promotion communicates the benefits. Modern marketers extend these with digital tactics—digital promotion, e‑commerce place, subscription pricing models—while still adhering to the core principles. Visuals include a 4Ps wheel and a product‑price‑place‑promotion matrix.  
- Example/Demo:  
  Interactive worksheet: Participants map the 4Ps for a new eco‑friendly water bottle. They identify product features, pricing strategy (premium vs. discount), distribution channels (online store, local retailers), and promotion mix (social media, influencer partnership, in‑store displays). The facilitator then highlights gaps and alignment issues, referencing Google Analytics dashboards and HubSpot CRM data.  
- Engagement Prompt:  
  Activity: “Create a 4Ps matrix for a product you use daily and share one insight about how the company could improve its marketing mix.” Participants post their matrices in the discussion forum.  
- Timing: 720 minutes  

### Closing
- Recap:  
  - Marketing is a customer‑centric function that integrates cross‑functional teams to deliver value.  
  - The 4Ps framework provides a structured way to analyze and design marketing strategies.  
- Transition/Next Steps:  
  In the next module, you will learn how to conduct market research and segment customers to inform the 4Ps decisions.  
- Assessment Prep:  
  Be ready to answer a scenario‑based quiz that asks you to apply the 4Ps to a new product launch, justify your choices, and explain how you would measure success.
