Section | Key Findings | Practical Implications |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Domain Trends (2025)** | • AI‑driven personalization & predictive analytics dominate marketing strategy. <br>• Ethical AI governance is a new compliance requirement (SMPS AI Governance Templates). <br>• Customer experience (CX) metrics are now core KPIs; data‑rich dashboards are standard. <br>• Hybrid “in‑person + digital” touchpoints require cross‑functional alignment. | • Highlight AI use cases in the script (e.g., chatbots, recommendation engines). <br>• Emphasize ethical considerations in the 4Ps discussion. <br>• Use CX dashboards as visual examples. |\n| **Prerequisite Skills** | • Basic data literacy (reading charts, interpreting metrics). <br>• Familiarity with digital tools (email, social media, analytics). <br>• Cross‑functional collaboration mindset. | • Include a quick “skill check” slide or pre‑module quiz to gauge readiness. <br>• Offer optional “Data Basics” micro‑learning before the module. |\n| **Common Misconceptions (4Ps)** | 1. **Marketing = Advertising** – 4Ps cover product, price, place, promotion. <br>2. **More is better** – Quantity > quality is a myth. <br>3. **All platforms are required** – Focus on the right channels. <br>4. **Marketing is purely creative** – Data and strategy are equally critical. | • Address each myth in Slide\u202f2 (use a “Myth vs. Fact” graphic). <br>• Include a short interactive poll to surface learners’ pre‑conceptions. |\n| **Accessibility** | • WCAG\u202f2.2 AA compliance for all slide content. <br>• SCORM package must support screen readers and keyboard navigation. <br>• Provide transcripts for audio/video elements. | • Use high‑contrast color palettes and large fonts. <br>• Add alt‑text to all images/diagrams. <br>• Ensure SCORM quizzes are compatible with LMS accessibility tools. |\n| **Recommended Visuals / Diagrams** | • **4Ps Wheel** – concentric circles or a Venn diagram showing inter‑dependence. <br>• **Product‑Price‑Place‑Promotion Matrix** – grid mapping key decisions. <br>• **Case‑Study Flowchart** – step‑by‑step mapping of a real product launch. <br>• **AI‑Driven Customer Journey Map** – illustrate personalization. | • Keep diagrams simple (≤\u202f4 elements). <br>• Use icons and colour‑coding for quick comprehension. <br>• Embed interactive hotspots in SCORM quiz for deeper exploration. |\n| **Best Assessment Practices (SCORM)** | • **Scenario‑Based Quizzes**: Use branching logic to simulate decision paths. <br>• **Immediate Feedback**: Provide rationale for each answer. <br>• **Performance Thresholds**: ≥\u202f80\u202f% accuracy, justification, and application. <br>• **Data Capture**: Store answers in LMS gradebook via SCORM 1.2/2004. | • Author quizzes in Articulate Storyline or Adobe Captivate (both export SCORM 1.2/2004). <br>• Use QTI‑compatible authoring for future Common Cartridge conversion. <br>• Test on multiple LMSs (Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard) before deployment. |\n| **Datasets / Tools** | • **SMPS AI Insights Reports** (Q3‑Q4\u202f2025) – provide real‑world AI trend data. <br>• **Google Analytics / Adobe Analytics** – sample dashboards for CX metrics. <br>• **HubSpot CRM** – demo of product‑price‑place‑promotion data entry. <br>• **Excel / Google Sheets** – simple spreadsheet for 4Ps cost‑benefit analysis. | • Provide downloadable sample spreadsheets. <br>• Offer a short “tool‑tour” video (≤\u202f2\u202fmin) embedded in the module. |\n| **Standards / Terminology** | • **SCORM 1.2 / 2004** – packaging & tracking. <br>• **IMS Common Cartridge** – future‑proofing for richer assessments. <br>• **Dublin Core Metadata** – for content discoverability. <br>• **QTI 2.1** – for advanced quiz logic. | • Include a glossary slide (Slide\u202f3) with key terms. <br>• Link glossary terms to external resources (e.g., SMPS website). |\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Script / Slide Enhancements\n\n| Slide | Enhancement | Rationale |\n|-------|-------------|-----------|\n| 1 | Add a “Marketing in 2025” timeline graphic (AI, CX, hybrid touchpoints). | Sets context and aligns with domain trends. |\n| 2 | Split the 4Ps wheel into two layers: core vs. digital extensions (e.g., “Digital Promotion”). | Highlights evolving nature of each P. |\n| 3 | Use a real‑world case (e.g., a tech startup launching a SaaS product) and overlay the 4Ps matrix. | Demonstrates application and gap analysis. |\n| 4 | Insert a quick “Myth vs. Fact” pop‑up for each misconception. | Engages learners and corrects false beliefs. |\n| 5 | Provide a short “Next Steps” slide with links to datasets and tools. | Encourages self‑study and practical application. |\n\n---\n\n### Assessment Design Checklist\n\n1. **Learning Objectives Alignment** – Each quiz question maps to a specific outcome.  \n2. **Scenario Relevance** – Use the case study from Slide\u202f3 as the scenario base.  \n3. **SCORM Compliance** – Test package on Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard.  \n4. **Accessibility** – Ensure all quiz elements are keyboard‑navigable and screen‑reader friendly.  \n5. **Feedback Loop** – Immediate, explanatory feedback for correct/incorrect answers.  \n6. **Scoring & Thresholds** – Automate pass/fail based on ≥\u202f80\u202f% accuracy, justification, and application.  \n7. **Data Export** – Verify gradebook integration and data export to CSV for analytics.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Integrate AI Examples** early to capture attention and illustrate relevance.  \n- **Use Interactive Diagrams** in the SCORM package to reinforce the 4Ps framework.  \n- **Provide a “Marketing Toolkit” PDF** (including templates, glossary, and tool links) as a downloadable resource.  \n- **Schedule a live Q&A** (15\u202fmin) after the module to address lingering misconceptions.  \n- **Plan for Future Updates**: Convert SCORM package to Common Cartridge to future‑proof the content.  \n\nThis concise report equips you to refine the script, slide deck, and assessment so that the module meets contemporary marketing trends, addresses common misconceptions, and delivers an accessible, standards‑compliant learning experience.', 'status': 'completed'}
