Domain Trends (2025)\n\n| Trend | What it means for the module | Why it matters |\n|-------|------------------------------|----------------|\n| **AI‑driven content & automation** – chatbots, AI copy‑writers, programmatic ad buying | Students will see how AI can generate posts, schedule, and optimise in real time. | AI is now a core capability; students must understand its role and limits. |\n| **Hyper‑personalisation & data‑first strategy** – dynamic targeting, behavioural segmentation | Emphasise data‑collection, privacy‑compliant segmentation, and personalised messaging. | Personalisation drives higher engagement and ROI. |\n| **Privacy‑centric marketing** – GDPR‑style rules, cookie‑less tracking, data‑subject rights | Teach ethical data use, consent flows, and privacy‑friendly analytics. | Compliance is mandatory; non‑compliance can cost millions. |\n| **Social‑commerce & shoppable posts** – in‑app purchases, AR try‑ons | Show how social platforms become sales channels. | Students will plan campaigns that close the loop from awareness to purchase. |\n| **Cross‑channel attribution & AI analytics** – unified dashboards, predictive modelling | Introduce KPI dashboards that blend social, web, and email data. | Helps students justify spend and optimise budgets. |\n\n*Sources:* Digital Marketing Institute (Apr\u202f22\u202f2025) & Harvard Business Review (Apr\u202f14\u202f2025).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Prerequisite Skills (Modules\u202f1 &\u202f2)\n\n| Skill | How it is used in this module |\n|-------|------------------------------|\n| **Basic digital literacy** – navigating social platforms, using analytics dashboards | Students will create a campaign on a chosen platform. |\n| **Fundamental marketing concepts** – 4Ps, brand positioning | These underpin the campaign brief and KPI selection. |\n| **Data interpretation** – reading charts, basic Excel | Needed for KPI dashboard creation and A/B testing analysis. |\n| **Content creation basics** – copywriting, visual design | Students will draft posts and schedule them. |\n| **Project management** – timelines, deliverables | Essential for the content calendar and campaign timeline. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common Misconceptions (Non‑Marketing Staff)\n\n| Misconception | Reality | How to address it in the module |\n|---------------|---------|---------------------------------|\n| “Social media is just posting.” | A strategic, data‑driven process with clear objectives. | Use the *Social Media Campaign Blueprint* slide to show the full cycle. |\n| “Engagement = success.” | Engagement is a metric, not the goal; conversion and ROI matter. | Include KPI dashboard examples that link engagement to business outcomes. |\n| “Paid ads are the only way to reach people.” | Organic reach, influencer partnerships, and paid media all play roles. | Discuss budget allocation and platform mix. |\n| “Analytics are optional.” | Analytics inform optimisation and ROI measurement. | Embed live Q&A and a mini‑lab on interpreting analytics. |\n| “AI will replace marketers.” | AI augments, not replaces; human insight remains critical. | Highlight AI tools but stress creative strategy. |\n\n*Source:* LinkedIn post by Zaria\u202fParvez (Jan\u202f30\u202f2023) – debunking myths about social media strategy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Accessibility (WCAG\u202f2.1 Level\u202fAA)\n\n| Element | Guideline | Practical tip |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Color contrast** | ≥\u202f4.5:1 for normal text, ≥\u202f3:1 for large text | Use WebAIM Contrast Checker; avoid red/green combos. |\n| **Font size** | ≥\u202f18\u202fpt for presentations | Set default slide font to 24\u202fpt for body text. |\n| **Alt text** | Provide descriptive alt text for all images | Use PowerPoint’s “Alt Text” field; keep <\u202f150\u202fchars. |\n| **Clear headings** | Logical hierarchy (H1, H2…) | Use slide titles as H1, subtitles as H2. |\n| **Avoid color‑only cues** | Add icons or labels | Don’t rely solely on color to indicate status. |\n| **Hyperlinks** | Descriptive link text | Replace “click here” with “Download KPI dashboard template.” |\n\n*Sources:* A&M‑SA ADA Resources (2024) & ADA.gov fact sheet (2024).\n\n---\n\n## 5.
