### Sections

1. Campaign Blueprint: Platform Selection & Planning  
- Key Points:  
  - Define objectives, target audience, and platform fit  
  - Build a content calendar and KPI dashboard  
- Explanation:  
  In this section learners translate high‑level marketing goals into a concrete social‑media strategy. They will choose a platform that aligns with their audience, outline key performance indicators, and schedule content over a 4‑week cycle. The module integrates current domain trends such as AI‑driven content creation, hyper‑personalisation, and privacy‑centric analytics. Prerequisite skills—basic digital literacy, fundamental marketing concepts, data interpretation, content creation basics, and project management—are applied throughout. Common misconceptions (e.g., “social media is just posting” or “engagement equals success”) are addressed by linking each activity to measurable business outcomes. Accessibility is maintained by using high‑contrast visuals, clear headings, and descriptive alt text for all images.  
- Example/Demo:  
  Demonstrate a 4‑week content calendar for a hypothetical eco‑friendly product on Instagram, showing post types, timing, and associated KPIs (reach, engagement, click‑through). The demo uses a Canva‑created template and a Google Sheets KPI dashboard mock‑up.  
- Engagement Prompt:  
  “Identify the top 3 platforms for your brand’s target demographic and justify your choice using audience data.”  
- Timing: 12 hours  

2. Measurement, Optimization & Stakeholder Communication  
- Key Points:  
  - Implement A/B testing and interpret analytics  
  - Translate data into insights for non‑marketing stakeholders  
- Explanation:  
  Learners will run split tests on creative and copy, read platform insights dashboards, and craft concise reports that link metrics to business outcomes such as conversion and ROI. The section emphasizes cross‑channel attribution, unified dashboards, and continuous improvement loops. It also reinforces terminology standards (4Ps, KPI, ROI, CAC, LTV, CTR, CPM, CPC, A/B testing, funnel, attribution).  
- Example/Demo:  
  Live walkthrough of Facebook Ads Manager A/B test, followed by creating a KPI dashboard in Google Sheets and summarizing findings in a 5‑minute presentation. A peer‑review exercise uses a structured rubric aligned with best assessment practices.  
- Engagement Prompt:  
  “Create a one‑page KPI snapshot and draft a key takeaway for a senior manager who is unfamiliar with digital metrics.”  
- Timing: 12 hours
